I'm a Louisiana native, living in Baton Rouge with my wife, Heather, and [Lil
Sebastian][]. We enjoy traveling when we can, with [Kauai, HI][] being one of
our favorite places to visit.

I've been working remotely since 2011 and presently work at [Clearbit][], where
I help build APIs and integrations for business data. I primarily write Ruby at
Clearbit, but also use Rails and JavaScript in personal projects.

Despite growing up in a sweltering environment, I'm a hockey fan and cheer the
Boston Bruins. I also enjoy watching Premier League soccer and curling.

You can follow me on [AngelList][], [GitHub][], [Product Hunt][], and
[Twitter][], [e-mail me][] if you'd like to chat, or view my [résumé][].
