I'm from Louisiana but currently living in Boston with my wife, Heather, and
[Lil Sebastian][]. We enjoy traveling when we can, with [Kauai, HI][] being one
of our favorite places to visit.

I've been working remotely since 2011 and currently work at [ezCater][], where I
help design and build platform APIs using GraphQL. I primarily use Ruby on Rails
at ezCater, but also use JavaScript in personal projects.

Despite growing up in a sweltering environment, I'm a huge hockey fan and cheer
for the Boston Bruins. I also enjoy watching Premier League soccer and curling.

You can follow me on [AngelList][], [GitHub][], [Product Hunt][], and
[Twitter][]. You can also [e-mail me][] if you'd like to chat, or view my
[résumé][].
